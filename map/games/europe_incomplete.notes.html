This current mod reflects the original Europe edition.
		<br>
		<br>Special Cash Advance:
		<br>Before the game starts each side is given a 12 PU bid.  
		So Germany gets a 12 pu bid, and the Allies get a 12 pu bid which they can give to one allied country or divide among allied countries.  
		This bid money can only be used to purchase and place units where you already have units.
		<br>(The Allied 12 pu starts out as Russian, however you can change it and divide it however you choose.)
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>ATTENTION: 
		<br>Escorting and Intercepting Strategic Bombing Raids is Not Yet Supported!
		<br>Soviet Patriotic War converting of Allied units is Supported! However, you must pay attention and remember not to move the units during the next Soviet turn!
		<br>Middle East capturing of PUs directly from Allies (instead of from bank) is Not Yet Supported! Please use edit mode to delete UK and/or USA pus.
		<br>According to rules, you can place unlimited units in original factories that start the game under your control, but follow regular v2-v3 rules for placement restricted by territory value on all captured factories.
		<br>Europe follows a hybrid v1, v2, v3 rules-set.  Mostly v2, except shore bombardment should get return shot, subs need a destroyer unit present to be hit by air, etc.
		<br>
		<br>There are a few elements still to be added however, for example, the middle east territories 
		are counted as regular UK territories as their special rules are also not yet currently implemented.  
		Strategic bombing for now behaves exactly as regular Axis and Allies strategic bombing.  Also 
		there is no extra Russia bonus of commandeering allied units and converting them to Russian owned 
		at this time.  All units created by a nation will stay under ownership by that nation throughout 
		the entire game.
